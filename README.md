## 🚀 Highlights

CAT-3DGS Pro sets a new benchmark for 3DGS compression.
-	CAT-3DGS Pro improves CAT-3DGS in both complexity and rate-distortion (RD) performance.
-	VM hyperprior: Enhances training and inference speed.
-	Alternate rate-distortion optimization (A-RDO): Improves training speed and RD.
- Uniform sampling rate optimization (USRO): Further boosts RD.
